# pyenv-link
A [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) plugin for linking python versions and virtual envs into your pyenv root.

This plugin recommends the [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv/) plugin.

## Installation

This will install the latest development version of *pyenv-link* into
the `$(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-link` directory.

**Important note:**  If you installed pyenv into a non-standard directory, make
sure that you clone this repo into the 'plugins' directory of wherever you
installed into.

From inside that directory you can:
 - Check out a specific release tag.
 - Get the latest development release by running `git pull` to download the
   latest changes.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/real-yfprojects/pyenv-link.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-link
```

For the Fish shell:

```fish
git clone https://github.com/real-yfprojects/pyenv-link.git (pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-link
```

## Usage

Make an arbitrary virtualenv available through pyenv. This automatically guesses a fitting name from the prompt, the directory name or the location of the venv.

```console
$ pyenv link version .venv
Linked new version named myproject-py3.10
```

You can also specify a name to use for the venv.

```console
$ pyenv link version .venv myname
Linked new version named myname
```

Now you can make pyenv activate/use the venv automatically:

```console
$ pyenv local myproject-py3.10
```
